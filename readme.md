# Algorithmic Economics HW 4 - Explore Then Commit by Artie Humphreys (bsg6vr)

As a heads up, sorry for not writing this in Python. This document will act as documentation for running this code if desired. I wrote this implementation in C++ as a challenge. I left some comments in some of the files that explain what the code is doing but hopefully the function and variable names make it self-explanatory. To run it, you will need to download cmake at https://cmake.org/download/ and a c++ compiler at https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/. This will compile the source code and cmake will be used to help automate the process. If you have a mac, clang is already installed so there is no need to download that.

If you don't want to go through that process, you can copy and paste all of my code (making sure that you don't have `pragma once` statements or multiple of the same includes) into an online compiler like https://www.programiz.com/cpp-programming/online-compiler/.

If you choose to run it on your computer, go to the root of the folder `explore-then-commit` and run

```
cmake build; sh scripts/run.sh
```

The `run.sh` file runs the program once it is built using cmake. If you are having trouble running my code, I will provide a text file of the output for one run
